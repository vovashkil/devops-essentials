# DevOps Essentials on AWS
"Continuous delivery is a [DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/) software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. It expands upon [continuous integration](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/) by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. When continuous delivery is implemented properly, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process." [Source](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/)

AWS CodePipeline (along with other AWS Developer Tools such as AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy) is a fully-managed service for orchestrating continuous delivery. In *[DevOps Essentials on AWS Complete Video Course](https://www.udemy.com/devops-essentials-on-aws/)*, you'll learn how to continuous delivery pipelines using AWS services and tools so if you're some type of software or DevOps-focused engineer or architect interested in learning how to use [AWS Developer Tools](https://aws.amazon.com/products/developer-tools/) to create a full-lifecycle software delivery solution, it's the course for you. The focus of the course is on deployment pipeline architectures and its implementations versus software architectures.
