                        <p>"AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.</p>

                        <p>You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time.</p>

                        <p>There is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk - you pay only for the AWS resources needed to store and run your applications."</p> (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Source</a>)</p>
