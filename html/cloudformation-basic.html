                        <p>"AWS CloudFormation provides a common language for you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment. CloudFormation allows you to use a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. This file serves as the single source of truth for your cloud environment."</p>

                            <li>Review <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html">Template Anatomy</a></li>                        
                            <li>Review the top-level objects of a CloudFormation template: <strong>AWSTemplateFormatVersion</strong>, <strong>Description</strong>, <strong>Parameters</strong>, <strong>Resources</strong>, <strong>Mappings</strong>, <strong>Outputs</strong> in the CloudFormation template. The Resources object is the only object that's required</li>
                            <li><strong>Resources</strong> contain the definitions of the AWS resources you want to create with the template. Each resource is listed separately and specifies the properties necessary for creating that particular resource. The resource declaration begins with a String that specifies the logical name for the resource. The logical name can be used to refer to the resources within the template.</li>
                            <li>You use the <strong>Parameters</strong>  to declare values that can be passed to the template when you create the Stack. A parameter is an effective way to specify anything you want users to customize or store in the template itself.</li>
                            <li>You use <strong>Mappings</strong> to declare conditional values that are evaluated in a similar manner as a switch statement. The template uses Mappings to select the correct AMI for the Region and the Architecture Type for the instance type.</li>
                            <li><strong>Outputs</strong> define custom values that are returned by the cfn-describe-stacks command and in the AWS Management Console Outputs tab after the stack is created. You can use Output values to return information from the resources in the stacks such as the URL for a website created in the template.   </li>
