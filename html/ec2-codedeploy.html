                    <p>Congratulations! Your environment is ready.
<p>Sample environment:
We launched a Classic load balancer (BlueGreenLoadBalancer-8ilk6o4) and an Auto Scaling group (CodeDeployBGStack-8ilk6o4-BlueGreenAutoScalingGroup-1N71ZQXAM6F4P) of three t2.micro EC2 instances.</p>

<p>Sample application:
We installed a sample application using an AWS CodeDeploy in-place deployment.</p>

<p>You can download the application code:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-codedeploy-us-east-1/samples/latest/SampleApp_Linux.zip</p>

<p>You can view the sample web page using your web browser:
http://BlueGreenLoadBalancer-8ilk6o4-1182982190.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com</p>

</p>Sample blue/green deployment:
This is the new application revision that will be installed by the blue/green deployment.</p>
You can download the application code:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-codedeploy-us-east-1/samples/latest/SampleApp2_Linux.zip

</p>After the application revision is installed, you can view it using your web browser:
http://BlueGreenLoadBalancer-8ilk6o4-1182982190.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com</p>

</p>Cleanup:
After you finish examining the sample application, you can clean up your sample environment resources. In the Auto Scaling console, delete the Auto Scaling group prefixed with CodeDeploy_BlueGreenDemoFleet-8ilk6o4. In the AWS CloudFormation console, delete the stack named CodeDeployBGStack-8ilk6o4.
To continue the sample deployment, choose Start blue/green deployment.</p>
