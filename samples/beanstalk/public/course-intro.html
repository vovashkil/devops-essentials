                        <p>DevOps Essentials on AWS is a solutions-focused LiveLesson. It's the right video course if you're some type of software or DevOps-focused engineer or architect interested in learning how to use AWS Developer Tools to create a full-lifecycle softwre delivery solution. This LiveLesson shows you how to implement deployment pipelines using the AWS Developer Tools. The focus of the LiveLesson is on deployment pipeline architectures versus software architectures (e.g., monoliths, microservices, FaaS, BaaS, etc.). This LiveLesson is for you if you want to see various sample solutions for end-to-end automation of your infrastructure and pipelines.</p>

                       <p>The DevOps Essentials LiveLessons has a heavy focus on the use of AWS Developer Tools and other services, including: </p>
                        <ul class="edited-ul">
                            <li><strong>AWS CloudFormation</strong> - a tool you can use to automate the provisioning of AWS resources</li>
                            <li><strong>AWS CodePipeline</strong> - which provides the capability to orchestrate your software delivery workflows</li>
                            <li><strong>AWS CodeCommit</strong> - a Git-based version-control repository</li>
                            <li><strong>AWS CodeBuild</strong> - a fully-managed service for running automated builds, tests, and static analysis</li>
                            <li><strong>AWS CodeDeploy</strong> - a fully-managed service for deploying software to environments</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>AWS CodePipeline is the primary tool used in <strong>all</strong> the examples of this LiveLesson. All of the solutions are automated via CloudFormation. There are seven examples that use many of the AWS Developer Tools. All of the examples are available from a GitHub repository that will be referenced throughout this LiveLesson. All of the examples are based on the static website that you're viewing now and will be used to walk viewers through the lesson. The seven example solutions are: </p>
                        <ul class="edited-ul">
                            <li>Static Website (i.e., AWS S3 hosted)</li>
                            <li>EC2 (traditional EC2 deployment with CodeBuild and CodeDeploy on EC2 instances)</li>
                            <li>OpsWorks</li>
                            <li>Elastic Beanstalk</li>
                            <li>ECS</li>
                            <li>Serverless</li>
                            <li>CodeStar</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>For each of the lessons, this LiveLesson will add additional complexity by adding additional stages, actions, databases, and services into the static website solution. While the LiveLesson predominantly uses AWS tools, there will be some third-party integratations and open-source tools incorporated into the examples. You can fork the GitHub repository to make your own changes.</p>

                    <p>In Lesson 1, you will be able to describe the basic components and tools of a deployment pipeline, describe DevOps, describe patterns of effective culture, learn team organization patterns, and the basics of establishing Continuous Delivery to deliver software on demand.</p>

                    <p>In Lesson 2, you will configure the course prerequisites on your computer, manually provision the static website, describe how to orchestrate software workflows in CodePipeline, store software assets in CodeCommit, Build and test software in CodeBuild, describe the architecture and launch the solution, provision AWS resources in CloudFormation, and orchestrate solution in CodePipeline.</p>

                    <p>In Lesson 3, you will describe basic EC2 features, describe how to deploy applications using CodeDeploy, describe the architecture and launch the solution, provision AWS resources in CloudFormation, and orchestrate the EC2-based solution in CodePipeline.</p>

                     <p>In Lesson 4, you will describe the basic features of OpsWorks, describe the architecture and launch the solution, provision AWS resources in CloudFormation, and orchestrate the solution in CodePipeline</p>

                     <p>In Lesson 5, you will describe basic features of Elastic Beanstalk, describe the architecture and launch the solution, provision AWS resources in CloudFormation, orchestrate solution in CodePipeline</p>

                     <p>In Lesson 6, you will describe basic features of EC2 Container Service (ECS), Describe the architecture and launch the solution, provision AWS resources in CloudFormation, orchestrate solution in CodePipeline</p>

                     <p>In Lesson 7, you will describe basic features of Serverless, describe the Serverless Application Model, describe the architecture and launch the solution, provision AWS resources in CloudFormation, and orchestrate solution in CodePipeline</p>

                     <p>In Lesson 8, you will launch solution from Project Template, configure Dashboard for Project, manage code changes, deploy software, orchestrate software using Pipeline, manage team members, and extend solution using Extensions.</p>

                    <p>This course is solutions focused. I spend some time at the beginning describing DevOps, Continuous Delivery, and AWS. It assumes you're some type of software or DevOps-focused engineer or architect. The course focuses on how to implement the deployment pipeline architecture pattern using various AWS services and tools. I don't dive deep into software architectures (e.g., monoliths, microservices, FaaS, BaaS, etc.). Instead, I let you decide how you can use the deployment pipeline patterns for various architectures. This course is for you if you want to see various sample solutions for end-to-end automation of your infrastructure and pipelines.</p>

                    <p>With very few exceptions, I use only AWS tools. These tools include: </p>
                     <ul class="edited-ul">
                            <li>AWS CloudFormation</li>
                            <li>AWS CodePipeline</li>
                            <li>AWS CodeCommit</li>
                            <li>AWS CodeBuild</li>
                            <li>AWS CodeDeploy</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>AWS CodePipeline is the primary tool for <strong>all</strong> the examples. All of the solutons are automated via CloudFormation. There are seven examples that use many of the tools above. All of the examples are available from our GitHub repository. All seven examples are based on the static website. This website is the one you're viewing now and will be used to walk viewers through the lesson. The seven example solutions are: </p>
                        <ul class="edited-ul">
                            <li>Static Website (i.e., AWS S3 hosted)</li>
                            <li>EC2 (traditional EC2 deployment with CodeBuild and CodeDeploy on EC2 instances)</li>
                            <li>OpsWorks</li>
                            <li>Elastic Beanstalk</li>
                            <li>ECS</li>
                            <li>Serverless</li>
                            <li>CodeStar</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>I add additional complexity to the "static website" to include Java builds, services running on containers, databases, etc., but all the examples use this website to make the live changes. I incorporate the use of some third-party integratations and open-source tools into the actions. Viewers can fork the repository to make their own changes.</p>
                    
                    <p>There will be a lesson for each of seven examples listed above. Each lesson will follow a similar format: </p> 
                        <ul class="edited-ul">
                            <li><strong>Introduction</strong> - Introduce the learning objectives</li>
                            <li><strong>Prerequisites</strong> - Describe any setup/configuration the viewer needs to perform</li>
                            <li><strong>Architecture</strong> - Show the architecture and capability to click a Launch Stack button. To see an example, go to <em>Lesson 2.2 (Static Website: Architecture)</em></li>
                            <li><strong>Code</strong> - Walk through the CloudFormation template(s) in detail since this is the basis for the automation of the entire solution. Will also view buildspec.yml, build, test and deploy scripts, appspec.yml, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stages</strong> - For most lessons, there will be six stages in a pipeline - Source, Build, Dev, PreProd, Canary, and Production. There will be a separate sublesson for each of the stages that describe the various actions, transitions, etc. that make up the pipeline. I describe each of the stages next.</li>
                            <li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Using CloudWatch to view pipeline and production activity</li>
                            <li><strong>Summary</strong> - A summary of what you learned</li>
                            <li><strong>Quiz</strong> - You can test your knowledge with a quiz at the end of the lesson</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>The stages are a focal point of each lesson. As I mentioned previously, most examples will include a six-stage pipeline as described below: </p> 
                        <ul class="edited-ul">
                            <li><strong>Source</strong> - Will use GitHib and CodeCommit as source providers</li>
                            <li><strong>Build</strong> - Unit tests, style checkers, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dev</strong> - Deploy and integration tests - used to test the running service.</li>
                            <li><strong>PreProd</strong> - Deploy and integration tests - used to test the combination of new software and production config.  Looks like prod, uses prod config, but doesn't receive customer traffic.</li>
                            <li><strong>Canary</strong> - OneBox Deployment (deploy and monitor)</li>
                            <li><strong>Production</strong> - Deploy to production (zonal, regional, etc.)</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Other tools and features to cover include: </p>
