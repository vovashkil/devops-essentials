                        <p>ECS allows you to run Docker containers on Amazon. The benefits of ECS and Docker include the following:
                         <ul class="edited-ul">
                            <li>Portability – You can build on one Linux operating system and have it work on others without modification. It’s also portable across environment types so you can build it in development and use the same image in production.
                            <li>Scalability – You can run multiple images on the same EC2 instance to scale thousands of tasks across a cluster.
                            <li>Speed – Increase your speed of development and speed of runtime execution.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>"ECS is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure." (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">Source</a>)</p>

                        <p>The reason you might use Docker-based containers over traditional virtual machine-based application deployments is that it allows a faster, more flexible, and still very robust immutable deployment pattern in comparison with services such as traditional Elastic Beanstalk, OpsWorks, or native EC2 instances.</p>

                        <p>While you can very effectively integrate Docker into Elastic Beanstalk, ECS provides greater overall flexibility.</p>

                        <p>The reason you might use ECS or Elastic Beanstalk containers with EC2 Container Registry over similar offerings such as Docker Hub or Docker Trusted Registry is higher performance, better availability, and lower pricing. In addition, ECR utilizes other AWS services such as IAM and S3, allowing you to compose more secure or robust patterns to meet your needs.</p>

                        <p>Based on the current implementation of Lambda, the reasons you might choose to utilize ECS instead of serverless architectures include - </p>
                        <ul class="edited-ul">
                            <li>Lower latency in request response time</li>
                            <li>Flexibility in the underlying language stack to use</li>
                            <li>Elimination of AWS Lambda service limits (requests per second, code size, total code runtime)</li>
                            <li>Greater control of the application runtime environment</li>
                            <li>The ability to link modules in ways not possible with Lambda functions</li>
                        </ul>
