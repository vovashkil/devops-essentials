                         <p>So, let’s have a look at one of key methods enterprises are using to be able to adhere to the statement I just made - from idea to production in one day. This is a short video on Continuous Delivery. </p>
                         <p>Continuous Delivery helps teams deliver software at the click of a button. Every part of of the software delivery process is automated - from commit to production. This includes the application code, configuration, infrastructure and data - really everything. One way to visualize Continuous Delivery is to imagine a factory assembly line where cross-functional engineers work on various parts of the software as is moves in its lifecycle. Now, in the past teams might only delivery software every few months or so - because of manual, error-prone processes. Often pieces of the delivery package go back and forth between teams separated by silos. This is a long, drawn-out and expensive exercise with the final package assembled at the 11th hour with teams vowing to never repeat it again. With Continuous Delivery, software can be delivered several times a day, once a week or as often as you want - it’s always in a releasable state. When compared to traditional delivery methods, Continuous Delivery offers two keys advantages. The first is that the software is always ready to release meaning you don’t stop and make a special effort to release the software. The second is that there aren’t any walls between the teams. Instead, there are autonomous teams that are made up of developers, testers, infrastructure, etc. all contributing to a single path to production. We’re not just talking about developer changes here. No matter if it’s a change to the infrastructure, data or whatever, the entire package gets built, tested, analyzed and deployed. When it passes all these checks, it becomes a release candidate that could potentially released to users, if the business chooses to do so. Now, when a problem is discovered, quick feedback notifies team members that something’s wrong that needs to be fixed and the assembly line stops. This is when team members make it a priority to fix the error and commit it so that it moves along in the path to production. So, in summary, Continuous Delivery is concerned with all parts of the software system and how all team members work as part of this single path to production. This way, software gets to users quicker and in a more predictable manner.</p>
