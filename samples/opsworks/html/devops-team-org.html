                         <p>To give you a concrete example, there was an engagement we were working on with a large enterprise in the mid 2000s, with hundreds of teams in an enterprise. One of the first teams we worked with was using effective Continuous Integration practices. To me, this is more than just setting up a Continuous Integration server and building when anyone commits some code, it means employing practices such as all team members committing their code at least once a day, writing automated tests, stopping the line when a build or test error occurs, and not getting changes when there's a CI error. Anyway, this team was effectively employing these CI practices and getting fast feedback. So, they’d spend a couple months in development and QA. The problem was that once they were "code complete", they'd then spend another 4-6 weeks working with Systems teams getting the software deployed to staging and production. This uncommon occurrence took this long for myriad reasons including the fact that 1) systems team of around 100 people supported these hundreds of teams and had to make priority-based decisions on which team to work with 2) The deployment processes that this Systems team used were different than the development team. The development team used a collection of scripts to setup their environments while the systems teams used manual “runbooks” to perform their deployment checklist. This meant that the Development/QA environments looked a lot different than the staging/production environments and this led to a lot of churn between the teams. The response from the Systems team was to “document more of the processes” so that they could be manually recreated.</p>
     
                        <p>Anyway, so we worked with the Systems/Operations teams and the development team to come up with a set of common deployment scripts that could be run in any environment. This reduced the time from a month or more to about one hour. </p>

                        <p>In this illustration, you see what a traditional team commonly looks like. While the centralized team names and functions might be different, a traditional organization structure typically has a 1-many teams who interface with centralized teams. The teams are responsible for building or developing the software and when they want to to put through a release process, they need to interface with these centralized teams. You see this represented as "gates". What do these gates typically look like? They usually come in the form of sending emails, filling out forms, submitting tickets or issues, having meetings, and anything else that presents a bottleneck in the process of getting software delivered to users. </p>

                    <p>On modern teams, organizations form cross-functional teams. These functions might include app developers, database, QA/testing, business analysis, infrastructure/operations, etc. on a small team of no more than 8-10 people. People on these pilots are 100% dedicated to the effort, but they might leverage the services of centralized teams - for example, security, infrastructure, SREs, etc. Ideally, these centralized teams should provide their services in a non-blocking manner. Often, this isn’t achievable overnight, but the results of the value-stream map should be used as a way of identifying the key bottlenecks and the teams should work with the pilots to seek ways of iteratively reducing these bottlenecks.</p>
                    <p>Here are some of the common organizational patterns of modern teams</p>
                        <ul class="edited-ul">
                            <li>Small cross-functional, self-organizing team</li>
                            <li>Two-pizza teams - usually less than 8 people</li>
                            <li>End-to-end responsibility for what they build - i.e. build, deploy, test, run, and support - the whole thing</li>
                            <li>Each team has a long-term mission</li>
                            <li>Team decides what to build, how to build it</li>
                            <li>Any authorized team member can and will release to production</li>
                            <li>Deployments and releases are small and frequent</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>The key attribute of these modern teams - in an enterprise, in particular - is that they are provided self-service capabilities from these centralized teams. Commonly, the services are provided through APIs or software they can be used in a self-service manner.</p>
